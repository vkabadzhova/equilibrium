//! The crate is simulating fluid dynamics and is showing it in a user-friendly
//! application built upon [egui](crates.io/crates/egui) from where various
//! parameters regarding the [simulation](crate::app::widgets::simulation_configs_menu)
//! (such as speed /size of step/, length
//! /number of frames/, etc), the [fluid](crate::app::widgets::fluid_configs_menu) (diffusion rate, viscousity, colour),
//! etc. can be adjusted. The simulation is grid- and CPU-based. The results of
//! the simulation are saved in the `rendered_images/` directory which is
//! located directly under the project's root directory. The results are also
//! shown during the processing of the simulation inside the applicaiton.
